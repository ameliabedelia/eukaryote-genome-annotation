# Overview

The following exercices will introduce you to methods in eukaryotic genome annotation. The following topics will be discussed in order:

**A. Crash course/lecture**  
 * Insights into eukryotic genome annotation *(not included in this wiki)*  
  
  
**B. Practical course**  
 * **B1.** Genome Browsers  
 * **B2.** Understanding male morphs in the ruff (*Philomachus pugnax*) - A genomics approach  

Note: the exercises are split into two separate tasks (B1 and B2). We suggest that you take a look at B2 first, as it requires a bit more runtime on your computer. While B2 is running, you can get started on B1.  

For the exercises in B2, you will need the **IGV genome browser**. The program can be copied from this location to your home folder */mnt/lectures/biol258/Day7/IGV* using:  
`cp -R /mnt/lectures/biol258/Day07/IGV $HOME`  

*Please note! The commands given in these pages are examples and they assume that you make sure that the input and output files are where they should be.*  
*Some times you may have to copy files to your current directory or expand the example commands to include correct/full paths!*  
  
**Software containers:** many of the tools used in this exercise are pretty complex to install. In order to avoid having to install them on each computer we are going to use software *containers*. These are *portable* environments in which you can install an operating system, a program or many programs and then copy the whole thing to whichever computer you like to run the software. Popular solutions are Docker and **Singularity** (which we will use here). The way to run a tool inside a container is pretty straight-forward:  

If you would run a command without container like this:  
`samtools sort -o rnaseq.sorted.bam rnaseq.bam`  

You would run the same command with a container like this:  
`singularity exec container.img samtools sort -o rnaseq.sorted.bam rnaseq.bam`  

Here `container.img` is a place holder, which you have to replace by the name of the actual container.  

Copy the singularity image for this exercise to your local hard drive:  
`cp -R /mnt/lectures/biol258/Day07/singularity.img $HOME`  

In order to be able to run the examples in the following exercises, you will have to add the following code in front of each command:  
`singularity exec $HOME/singularity.img <command execution here>`
