# Overview

The following exercices will introduce you to methods in eukaryotic genome annotation. The following topics will be discussed in order:

**A. Crash course/lecture**  
 * Insights into eukryotic genome annotation *(not included in this wiki)*  
  
  
**B. Practical course**  
 * **B1.** Genome Browsers  
 * **B2.** Understanding male morphs in the ruff (*Philomachus pugnax*) - A genomics approach  

Note: the exercises are split into two separate tasks (B1 and B2). We suggest that you take a look at B2 first, as it requires a bit more runtime on your computer. While B2 is running, you can get started on B1.  

For the exercises in B2, you will need the **IGV genome browser**. The program can be copied from this location to your home folder:  
/mnt/lectures/biol258/Day7/IGV  
using:  
`cp -R /mnt/lectures/biol258/Day07/IGV $HOME`  

*Please note! The commands given in there pages are examples and they assume that you make sure that the input and output files are where they should be.*
