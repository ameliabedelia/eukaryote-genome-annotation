# Overview

The following exercices will introduce you to methods in eukaryotic genome annotation. The following topics will be discussed in order:

**A. Crash course/lecture**  
 * Insights into eukryotic genome annotation *(not included in this wiki)*  
  
  
**B. Practical course**  
 * **B1.** Genome Browsers  
 * **B2.** Understanding male morphs in the ruff (*Philomachus pugnax*) - a genomics approach  

Note: the exercises are split into two separate tasks (B1 and B2). We suggest that you take a look at B2 first, as it requires a bit more runtime on your computer. While B2 is running, you can get started on B1.  

For the exercises in B2, you will need the **IGV genome browser**. The program can be copied from this location to your home folder */mnt/lectures/biol258/Day7/IGV* using:  
`cp -R /mnt/lectures/biol258/Day07/IGV $HOME`  

*Please note! The commands given in these pages are examples and they assume that you make sure that the input and output files are where they should be.*  
*Some times you may have to copy files to your current directory or expand the example commands to include correct/full paths!*  
  
### Software containers  
Many of the tools used in this exercise are pretty complex to install. In order to avoid having to install them on each computer we are going to use software *containers*. These are *portable* environments in which you can install an operating system, a program or many programs and then copy the whole thing to whichever computer you like to run the software. Popular solutions are Docker and **Singularity** (which we will use here). The way to run a tool inside a container is pretty straight-forward:  

If you would run a command without container like this:  
`samtools sort -o rnaseq.sorted.bam rnaseq.bam`  

You would run the same command with a container like this:  
`singularity exec container.img samtools sort -o rnaseq.sorted.bam rnaseq.bam`  

Here `container.img` is a place holder, which you have to replace by the name of the actual container.  

Copy the singularity image for this exercise to your local hard drive:  
`cp -R /mnt/lectures/biol258/Day07/singularity.img $HOME`  

In order to be able to run the examples in the following exercises, you will have to add the following code in front of each command:  
`singularity exec $HOME/singularity.img <command execution here>` 

# B1. Genome Browsers  
Genome browsers are an important tool for anyone working with eukaryote genome sequences. They can help visualize rich data sets and are often critical to the biological interpretation of findings from wet-lab or sequencing experiments.  
It is important to familiarize yourself with these resources so you understand what kind of features can be annotated and where to find this type of information.  
Try out the following URLs to get an impression of different Genome-Browser flavours. What features/annotations do these browsers offer? How do they display them? If you need some inspiration regarding which genes to inspect in EnsEMBL and UCSC, you can start with these:  
BRCA1, BRCA2, HOXA1  
* Ensembl Genome Browser (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
* UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu)
* NCBI's Genome Data Viewer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/gdv/)
* Metazome (http://www.metazome.net)  

Once you have done that, try completing the following tasks using the EnsEMBL genome portal linked above.  

**QB1.1:** How many protein-coding genes are annotated in the mouse (check the info page for mouse, accessible from the front page and then search for annotation statistics).  

**QB1.2:** How many non-coding genes are annotated in human? And in chicken?  

**QB1.3:** How many transcript variants are annotated in EnsEMBL for the human BRCA1 gene?  
How long is the longest protein product, how long the shortest?  

**QB1.4:** Are there differences between UCSC and EnsEMBL in BRCA1 number of transcripts?  (for UCSC, count the RefSeq transcripts)

**QB1.5:** What is the biological function of BRCA1? (you can check "Ontologies" --> "Molecular function")

**QB1.6:** In which diseases are BRCA1 and BRCA2 involved? (check "External references")

**QB1.7:** What are the external descriptors/ids for these genes (indicated by '*') and phenotypes/diseases (indicated by '#') in OMIM(MIM)?

**QB1.8:** Do orthologs of BRCA2 exist in chicken? (check EnsEMBL "Gene tab" --> "orthologs/paralogs")  
If yes, what is the gene id?

**QB1.9:** How deeply conserved (*i.e.* across taxonomic groups) is the TEX14 gene? ("Gene tab" --> "Comparative genomics" --> "gene tree")

**QB1.10:** How many exons does the TEX14 transcript with the longest protein product have? ("Gene tab" --> "Summary" --> "Show transcript table", then click on the transcript id)  
How many of these are coding exons?  
How long is the transcript, how long the protein product?  

**QB1.11:** In which tissues is the TEX14 gene strongly expressed? ("Gene tab" --> "External data" --> "Gene expression", scroll sideways to see all tested tissues)

**QB1.12:**  Which parts of the HOXA1 gene are most conserved across 37 mammalian genomes? ("Location tab" --> "Configure this page" --> "Comparative genomics", enable the correct track)  

**QB1.13:** Use EnsEMBL to get the protein sequence for the canonical (*i.e.* the dominant) transcript of the HOXA1 gene and blast it against the human proteome using the Blast/Blat tool provided by EnsEMBL (top of the page). How many hits do you find?  
What are the top-ranked proteins?  

# B2. Understanding male morphs in the ruff (*Philomachus pugnax*) - a genomics approach  
One of the key goals of genome sequencing is to understand biological phenomena on a molecular level. Examples include the cause of genetic diseases as well as phenotypic or even behavioral traits. A nice example of the latter was published in the journal Nature Genetics in 2015 by Swedish researchers [(Lamichhaney et al. Nature Genetics, 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3430). They had observed that a Nordic bird species known as "ruff" (German: "Kampfl√§ufer) has not one but three different male morphs. Male morphs are thought to be a display of fitness to attract mates. The morhps in the ruff are special though. In addition to the typical "ornamented" male (known as "Independents") there are also "Satellites" and "Feaders".
